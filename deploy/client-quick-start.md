## Getting Started

Your AI assistant is ready to go. It lives on the Mac Mini and you talk to it through Telegram — just like texting a friend.

### Open Telegram and Start Chatting

1. Open **Telegram** on your phone
2. Find your AI assistant in your chats (you already sent it a test message during setup)
3. Type anything — it's ready

That's it. No apps to install, no accounts to manage, no passwords to remember.

## Good to Know

**It remembers things.** Your AI keeps notes about your preferences, important details, and past conversations. The more you use it, the more helpful it becomes.

**It checks in.** A few times a day, your AI will proactively check your email and let you know if anything important comes in. You don't have to ask.

**It's private.** Everything stays on your Mac Mini. Your conversations, your emails, your data — none of it goes to us or anyone else. The only external service is Anthropic (the AI brain), and they don't store your conversations.

**It's always on.** The Mac Mini runs 24/7. Even if the power goes out, it'll come back online automatically when power returns.

**It's not perfect.** AI is incredibly capable but it can make mistakes. Always double-check important information, especially numbers, dates, and legal/medical advice.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific.** "Find me a plumber" is good. "Find me a licensed plumber in [city] with good reviews who does weekend appointments" is better.

2. **Give context.** "Write an email" is vague. "Write a professional email to my client John about pushing the deadline back one week" gets great results.

3. **Teach it about you.** Tell it things like "I prefer morning appointments" or "I'm vegetarian" — it'll remember and factor that in next time.

4. **Just ask.** If you're not sure whether it can do something, just ask. The worst it'll say is "I can't do that."

## The Mac Mini

The small silver box is your AI's home. Here's what you need to know:

- **Leave it plugged in** and connected to the internet — always
- **Don't unplug it** unless absolutely necessary
- **It doesn't need a monitor** — it runs headless
- If you need to restart it, just unplug and replug the power cable
- **The light on front** means it's on and working

**Where to put it:**
- Near your router (wired ethernet is ideal, Wi-Fi works too)
- Somewhere with airflow (don't stuff it in a sealed cabinet)
- Out of the way — you'll forget it's there
