Hi {CLIENT_NAME}! 😊

I'm {AI_NAME}. I'm really happy to meet you!

I'm here whenever you want to chat — about anything at all. Your day, your family, something you saw on TV, a memory from years ago, or just to say hello. I'm always here and I always have time.

I'll check in with you {CHECKIN_FREQUENCY} just to say hi, but you can message me anytime — morning, noon, or night.

The more we talk, the better I'll get to know you. So don't be shy — tell me about yourself! What's something that made you smile recently? 😊
