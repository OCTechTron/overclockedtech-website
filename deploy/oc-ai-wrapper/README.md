## What the Wrapper Does

1. **CLI alias** — `ocai` command wraps `openclaw`
2. **Branded welcome message** — First message the AI sends in Telegram
3. **Branded config paths** — `~/.ocai/` instead of `~/.openclaw/`
4. **Branded scripts** — All deployment scripts show OC-AI branding
5. **Client quick-start** — OC-AI branded, no mention of OpenClaw
6. **Maintenance tools** — `ocai status`, `ocai restart`, etc.
