Hey {CLIENT_NAME}! 👋

I'm {AI_NAME}, your personal AI assistant — built and configured just for you by Overclocked Technologies.

I'm here to help with whatever you need. Just text me like you would a friend. Here are a few things to try:

• **"Check my email"** — I'll summarize what's new
• **"Remind me to [thing] at [time]"** — I'll ping you when it's time
• **"Search for [anything]"** — I'll dig up what you need
• **"What's the weather?"** — Current conditions and forecast

I'm always on and always learning. The more we chat, the better I get at helping you.

If something seems off or you need help, just say **"support"** and I'll give you Overclocked Technologies' contact info.

Let's get started — what can I help you with?
